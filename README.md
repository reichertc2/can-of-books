* ([Front-End Repository](https://github.com/reichertc2/can-of-books)
* ([Front-End Deployed Site](https://reichertc2-can-of-books.netlify.app/)
* ([Back-End Repository](https://github.com/AngelaDzodzomenyo/can-of-books-backend.git)
* ([Back-End Deployed Site](https://can-of-books-backend01.herokuapp.com/)
* ([Trello Board](https://trello.com/c/cRVgbD8L/5-1-set-up-your-repositories))
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Collabration Agreement

### Logistiacal
* What hours will you be available to communicate?
    * afternoon/evenings a couple hours before class. 
* What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
    * We will use Slack for primary communication
* How often will you take breaks?
    * As needed. Depending on good stopping points as well. 
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    * Take advantage of lab day son Wednesday and Friday and Sunday
### Cooperative
* Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
    * Chris - across the board strong. Understand concepts
    * Angela - understands backend pretty well. 
* How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
    * We can bounce ideas off of each other. 
* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    * Angela - CSS and bootstrap, front end back end database communication
    * Chris - front end back end database communication 
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    * Paired programming and comments as necessary 
### Conflict Resolution
* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
    * Try to address it with team member and escalate if necessary 
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    * Communicate needs and escalate if necessary 
* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    * Explain as writing code. Leaving comments and stopping for a pulse check.
